/**
 * Sidecar Manager — P1-0 process-split skeleton supervisor.
 *
 * Context: step 1 of extracting the agent loop into a headless Node sidecar
 * process (design: docs/2026-07-19-phase1-process-split-design.md §1, §2,
 * §5 "P1-0"). In P1-0 the sidecar (`sidecar/index.mjs`) is an idle
 * newline-delimited-JSON JSON-RPC 2.0 echo/ping skeleton — it does NOT carry
 * any product behavior yet. This module is the shell-side supervisor: spawn
 * it, talk JSON-RPC to it over stdio, and keep it alive.
 *
 * It reuses the existing generic process bridge (`mcp_spawn` / `mcp_write` /
 * `mcp_kill` in src-tauri/src/lib.rs, already used by src/core/mcp/client.ts
 * for MCP stdio servers) instead of adding new Rust commands. That bridge's
 * PATH construction already appends the bundled Node runtime as a fallback,
 * so spawning the literal command `'node'` resolves even on machines with no
 * system Node install.
 *
 * ZERO product behavior depends on this today — every failure path here
 * MUST be fail-soft: log a warning and move on. Nothing in this module may
 * throw out of `startSidecar()` / `stopSidecar()`, and nothing here may
 * surface an error to the UI.
 *
 * ## Restart policy (documented per P1-0 spec)
 *
 * A single fixed process id (`abu-sidecar`) is reused across the sidecar's
 * entire lifetime — including every restart — rather than minting a new id
 * per spawn attempt (unlike `TauriStdioTransport` in mcp/client.ts, which
 * mints a unique id per MCP server connection). This lets Tauri event
 * listeners (`mcp-msg-*` / `mcp-err-*` / `mcp-close-*`) be registered ONCE
 * and reused across restarts, but it also means Rust's process table keeps a
 * dead child's entry around until `mcp_kill` is explicitly called (it does
 * not self-clean on unexpected exit) — so every spawn attempt, including the
 * very first one, is preceded by a defensive (best-effort, errors ignored)
 * `mcp_kill` to clear any stale entry before calling `mcp_spawn`.
 *
 * ANY failure — the initial spawn's `invoke('mcp_spawn')` rejecting, an
 * unexpected `mcp-close-abu-sidecar` event, a `mcp-hung-abu-sidecar` event
 * (Electron's main-process heartbeat — see "F1" below), or 3 consecutive
 * renderer-heartbeat ping timeouts (Tauri's own heartbeat — see "F1" below)
 * — is treated identically by
 * `scheduleRestartOrGiveUp()`: it counts as one entry in a rolling 60s
 * window, and unless that window already holds
 * more than `CRASH_LOOP_MAX_RESTARTS` (3) entries, it schedules exactly one
 * respawn attempt (after a small fixed backoff, `RESTART_BACKOFF_MS`, to
 * avoid a tight spawn loop). Once the window exceeds the threshold, the
 * supervisor gives up: status becomes `'failed'`, a single warning is
 * logged, and no further spawn attempts are made until `startSidecar()` is
 * called again from a clean/failed state.
 *
 * This means a spawn failure on the very first `startSidecar()` call does
 * NOT immediately land on `'failed'` — it is retried (as a "restart") up to
 * 3 more times within the 60s window before the supervisor gives up. Callers
 * never see this as a rejected promise: `startSidecar()` always resolves
 * once the first attempt concludes (success or handed off to the internal
 * retry scheduler); check `getSidecarStatus()` for the eventual outcome.
 *
 * ## Known limitation — stale close-event race
 *
 * Because `mcp-close-abu-sidecar` is a single shared event name reused
 * across every spawn generation, a close event from a process we just
 * force-killed ourselves (a `main-heartbeat-hung` or `heartbeat-hung`
 * forced restart via `forceRestartOnHang()`, or the defensive
 * pre-spawn kill) *could* theoretically arrive at the JS side after we've
 * already respawned and observed `status === 'running'` again, and be
 * misread as a fresh unexpected close. This is mitigated by ignoring close
 * events while `status` is `'starting'` or `'restarting'` (i.e. while a kill
 * we just issued is still in flight) or already `'stopped'`/`'failed'`. A
 * stale event arriving *after* that window closes would incorrectly trigger
 * one extra restart — self-healing (the crash-loop guard bounds the damage,
 * and the next heartbeat cycle re-validates real health). Exact
 * correlation would require tagging close events with a spawn generation on
 * the Rust side, which is out of scope for P1-0 (no Rust changes allowed).
 *
 * ## F1 — two-host heartbeat arrangement (gated by `window.__ABU_SHELL__`)
 *
 * The ping/pong liveness check must run on the process that owns the
 * sidecar's stdio, not a UI thread — a stalled renderer (heavy rendering, a
 * big synchronous task) can make a perfectly healthy sidecar's ping
 * "time out" purely because the renderer couldn't process the reply in
 * time, triggering a false restart storm. Every competitor (WorkBuddy,
 * Cursor, ChatGPT/Codex, TRAE) supervises liveness from the process that
 * owns the child's stdio, never from a UI thread.
 *
 * This module is SHARED by two hosts with different capabilities:
 *
 *   - **Electron** (`electron/mcpBridge.cjs`) has a main process that already
 *     owns the sidecar's stdio, so the ping loop runs THERE (opted in via
 *     `heartbeat: true` on the `mcp_spawn` call below) and signals a hang via
 *     the `mcp-hung-abu-sidecar` event.
 *   - **Tauri** (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs` `mcp_spawn`) has NO such main-process
 *     supervisor (verified — Rust's `mcp_spawn` ignores the unknown
 *     `heartbeat` field entirely), so for Tauri this module runs its OWN
 *     jank-tolerant renderer heartbeat (`startHeartbeat`/`runHeartbeat`,
 *     below) exactly as it always has.
 *
 * The host gate is `window.__ABU_SHELL__.mainSupervisesSidecar` — a global
 * `electron/preload.cjs` exposes via `contextBridge` (absent under Tauri).
 * `attemptSpawn()` only calls `startHeartbeat()` when that flag is falsy
 * (Tauri); Electron never starts the renderer heartbeat at all. The
 * `mcp-hung-abu-sidecar` listener is registered UNCONDITIONALLY in
 * `ensureListeners()` for both hosts — it's a harmless no-op under Tauri
 * (electron/mcpBridge.cjs never runs there, so the event never fires).
 * Death-on-crash detection (`mcp-close-abu-sidecar` → `handleClose()`) is
 * independent of both heartbeat paths and unaffected by any of this.
 *
 * Both heartbeat paths — the renderer heartbeat's failure-threshold branch
 * and the `mcp-hung-abu-sidecar` listener — funnel through the SAME
 * `forceRestartOnHang()` action (guarded by `status === 'running'`), so
 * there is exactly one restart action, never a double-restart from both
 * paths firing at once.
 *
 * Net invariant: Tauri ⇒ renderer heartbeat active, `mcp-hung` never fires;
 * Electron ⇒ renderer heartbeat never started, main heartbeat + `mcp-hung`
 * active. Host-exclusive by the gate, plus the `status` guard as a backstop.
